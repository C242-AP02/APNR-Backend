# Backend for APNR

This repository contains the backend server built with Node.js to facilitate communication between the frontend, machine learning (ML) service, Firestore, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). The backend handles operations like adding, updating, deleting, and fetching data from Firestore, as well as storing images generated by the ML service into GCS.

The backend uses the ML service from the [APNR-ML](https://github.com/C242-AP02/APNR-ML) repository to detect vehicle plates and process images.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account with Firebase and Storage access
- A machine learning URL to detect vehicle plates and process images from the [APNR-ML](https://github.com/C242-AP02/APNR-ML) repository

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the backend server on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/C242-AP02/APNR-Backend.git
cd APNR-Backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up .env File
Create a .env file in the root of the project to define the necessary environment variables.

Here is the .env configuration:
```env
ML_URL=<http://localhost:8080/>
BUCKET_NAME=<GCS BUCKET>
GCP_CREDENTIALS=<GCP Service Account Credentials in Base64 format>
```

### 3. Running the Server
```bash
npm run start

```
The server will start running on port 9000
